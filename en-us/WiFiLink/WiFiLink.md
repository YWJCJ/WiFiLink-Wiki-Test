## Installation ＆ Operation Notes

### Antenna Layout

- **Antenna Installation：** Ensure the two tail antennas are sufficiently spread apart to avoid entanglement, which could reduce signal interference.
- **Antenna Direction：** Adjust the antennas to point upwards whenever possible to avoid obstruction by the drone or battery, ensuring the best signal transmission.

### 4PIN Power Cable Connection

The wiring sequence of the two ends of the 4PIN power cable is opposite. Confirm the direction before connecting to ensure correct insertion and avoid damaging the device.

WiFiLink consumes about 14W and operates within a voltage range of 9-30V. Direct power from 3S and 4S batteries is acceptable, but avoid using 6S batteries directly due to high inrush voltage; instead, please use a BEC for buffering.
