## How to Flash WiFiLink

Card Flashing Steps:

- **Prepare Files**

  Copy the “WiFiLink-part0.bin” and “WiFiLink-part1.bin” card flashing files to the root directory of an empty SD card.
- **Upgrade Steps**

  Insert the SD card into the camera's main board and power it on. The camera will automatically enter upgrade mode (about 15 seconds).
  
  Once the upgrade is complete (about 1 minute), the green light will stay on and the SD card content will be cleared. After re-powering, a new configuration file “( gs.key” and“ user”) will be generated on the SD card.
